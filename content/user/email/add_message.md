Since Zen Cart 1.5.6, the capability to add a static message to every email has been built in.  Edit the file `includes/languages/english/YOURTEMPLATE/email_extras.php` and set the defined constant `EMAIL_ORDER_MESSAGE` with your message.  

If your Zen Cart version is older than 1.5.6, you may use the [Order Message](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2200) plugin.
