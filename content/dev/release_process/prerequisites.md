To run the release process, you must have the following:

- Running at least PHP 8.1. (This means `php -v` must run without an alias and must show php 8.1 or higher.)  Here are [guidelines for upgrading to PHP 8.1 on a Mac](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-upgrade-mac). 

- `Maintainer` access to the Zen Cart github repository.

- A local copy of the [VersionStamper](https://github.com/zencart/versionstamper) application.

- ssh access to the main Zen Cart website (zen-cart.com), and the Version/Ping server (ping.zen-cart.com).

- an up to date copy of both the branch that you are releasing, and the `main` branch.
