Zen Cart 2.1.0 introduced the ability to feature categories as well as products.

This page allows you to manage the list of featured categories.  Categories may be added to or removed from this list, and their dates for being on the list may optionally be set.

Featured categories can be added in one of two ways: 

- By selection (from a list of all categories)

- By Category ID (from a text field where the category ID is entered)

In stores with a large number of products the selection list can be unwieldy and thus entering an ID may be a speedier method.

When selection from a list is used, a new window is opened allowing the category to be selected.  The optional start/end date are also entered in this window.

When selection by ID is used, the infoBox on the right side allows the entry of the category ID.

<!-- Featured categories are displayed prominently when customers browse your store.  To learn more about this, read [how featured products are handled in the storefront](/user/products/featured_categories/).  -->
