PayPal is the most commonly used online payment method in the ecommerce world.

There are several integrations available, and the one(s) you choose will depend on your needs.

- [PayPal Express](/user/payment/paypal_express_checkout/) is the most commonly recommended integration.  It allows your customers to pay by their credit card or PayPal account, which they do offsite (not on your website).

- [PayPal Website Payments Pro]() allows customers to enter their credit card details on your site during the checkout process.  This more seamless experience is preferred by some vendors, but has a fee and minimum requirements.  Talk to your PayPal account rep to see if this is a good choice for you. 

- [PayPal Standard]() was the earliest PayPal integration, and is no longer recommended because it is less reliable.  See [PayPal Standard - Potential Problems](/user/payment/paypal_standard/) for details.

See the FAQ [PayPal Standard, Express and Pro - what's the difference?](/user/payment/paypal/) for a deeper discussion of the three older integrations.
