Editing an an entry will bring up a dialog like this:

There are many [built-in sideboxes](/user/sideboxes/sidebox_list/).  Choose the ones that would be most beneficial for your store.  You can also [design your own sidebox](/user/sideboxes/build_sidebox/) if what you need is not already available. 

For more information about sideboxes, see [the sidebox FAQs](/user/sideboxes/).

This page changed significantly in Zen Cart 1.5.8 due to 
the introduction of the `$uses_single_column_layout_settings` entry in the [template_info](/user/template/template_info/) file. 
Here is a picture of screen prior to 1.5.8:
