A plugin has been developed that demonstrates the use of observers to add a field to the products table.  [View Extra Product Fields on Github](https://github.com/torvista/Zen_Cart-Extra_Product_Fields).

As an alternative approach, you may wish to [create a child table](/dev/code/child_table_products/).
