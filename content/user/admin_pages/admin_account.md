The `Admin > Account` page allows you to change the email or reset the password 
for the logged in account.

This page offers the same functions as [Admins > Admin Users](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_users/), but only for the current logged in admin account. 
It is required since the logged in account might not have access to the Admin Users page if they have a restricted [Admin Profile](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_profiles/).
