Payment modules allow you to collect or arrange payment for an order.

The list of available payment modules may be seen by going to [Admin > Modules > Payment](/user/admin_pages/modules/payment/).

Zen Cart has a number of built-in payment modules which allow you to charge for your order in various ways: 

- PayPal  
- Square 
- AuthorizeNet

Zen Cart also integrates with a number of payment vendors using plugins:

- [2CheckOut](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=84)
- [Payflow for PayPal](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=212)

More payment plugins may be found in the [Payment module section of the Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=8).

Developers wishing to create a payment module should see the [dev FAQs on modules](/dev/code/modules/).
