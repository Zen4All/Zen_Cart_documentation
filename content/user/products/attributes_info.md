Zen Cart allows you to create variant products using its built-in 
attributes mechanism. 

Example: 

- A shirt in sizes small, medium and large.
- A book in hardcover or paperback 

Zen Cart offers the following types of attributes:

- radio buttons 
- checkboxes 
- drop-down lists 
- text boxes 
- file uploads 
- file downloads
- read only attributes 

Here's an example from the Zen Cart sample data of a product with a dropdown
attribute called *Media Type*, and three Checkboxes under *Gift Options*.
