Admin Account is like the [Admin Users](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_users) page, but filtered to only show the currently logged in admin account.

![Admin Users](/images/admin_account.png)

From this page, you may change your username or password.

The intent of this page is to provide a place for non-Superusers to manage their accounts.  The [Admin Users](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_users) page should only be accessible to superusers, since it permits you to change a user's profile. 

The Admin Account button is available on the top right hand side Admin navigation next to the [Version](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info/) link.
