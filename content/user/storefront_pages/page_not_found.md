When a reference is made to a non-existent page, Zen Cart redirects to a [define page](/user/template/define_pages/) called Page Not Found. 

The content of this page is, by default, the page not found define page content and a subset of the [site map page](/user/storefront_pages/site_map/), intended to guide the visitor to the desired page.
