Centerboxes are pieces of content that are displayed in the middle of the screen in the Zen Cart storefront. 

You can learn about [controlling centerboxes in the admin](/user/admin/centerboxes/) so that you only display the centerboxes that are most important to your store. 

This is the Featured Products centerbox.
