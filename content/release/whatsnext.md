## 2.2.0 
The improvements targeted for v2.2.0 include:

## 2.1.0 
The improvements targeted for v2.1.0 include:  
- New Feature: <a href="https://github.com/zencart/zencart/discussions/6428">Child Templates</a> will be supported, so that storeowners can more easily determine what has been changed from the base release of a template. (This may slip to a follow on release depending on schedules.)
