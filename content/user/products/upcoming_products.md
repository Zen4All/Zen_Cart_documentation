Upcoming Products are those whose Date Available setting on the 
[product editing page](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) is set to a date in the future. 

If you have created upcoming products, Zen Cart allows you to show them 
on the main page in the optional Upcoming Products [Centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes).

You may also configure upcoming products to appear in the following places: 

- on an empty shopping cart page with the setting on [Admin > Configuration > Stock](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/)
- below a [product listing](/user/products/product_listing/) using the settings on [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/)
