This need can arise if the customer created an account but [mis-typed their email](/user/running/mistyped_email/). 

There are a few options but this seems like the best one: 

1. Go to Admin > Customers > Orders click on the order
1. In the sidebar on the right, there is a button for Invoice
1. Click the invoice button
1. On the new page that opens, do a Print (either using Control-P or your browser's Print button from the File menu)
1. A dialog will come up, and prompt you to select a printer.  Select "Save as PDF".
1. Email the customer the resultant PDF of their order.

Alternately, tell them to login to their account and click the "My Account" link, where they can see the order themselves.
