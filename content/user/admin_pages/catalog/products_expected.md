This admin page allows you to see all  the products which have a 
*Date Available* field set to a future date. 
These are called the Expected Products (or "Upcoming Products).  

From this page, you may edit any product in the list of expected products. 

The Date Available field is set on the [Product Editing screen](/user/products/product_edit/). 

**Note:** Upcoming Products were called "Products Expected" in releases prior to v1.5.8.
