This page allows you to identify products with duplicate model numbers.

Duplicate model numbers can cause problems in a number of situations.  
Most stores will want to have unique model numbers for all their products. 

[POSM](/user/running/posm/) uses product model numbers to identify variants, and having duplicates may cause issues.  See the [POSM Help](https://github.com/lat9/options_stock_support/wiki/) for more details.
