The obvious reason Zen Cart admin exists is so that storeowners have a web interface to order processing and stock management.

A somewhat less obvious reason is to permit some configuration actions to be done via an admin panel.  

Plugin authors sometimes take shortcuts and advise users to modify this file or that one to tune the behavior of a plugin.  Zen Cart deliberately extracted some of those customization choices and put them into an admin panel, so that storeowners can do this by themselves and not need to depend on a developer.
