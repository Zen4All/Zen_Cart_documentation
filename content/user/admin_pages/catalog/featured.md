This page allows you to manage the list of featured products.  Products may be added to or removed from this list, and their dates for being on the list may optionally be set.  Since 1.5.7, products may be added by ID or by selection from a dropdown list.

Since 1.5.7, featured products can be added in one of two ways: 

- By selection (from a list of all products)

- By Product ID (from a text field where the product ID is entered)

The latter technique was added because a list of all products is unwieldy for stores with a large number of SKUs. 

When selection from a list is used, a new window is opened allowing the product to be selected.  The optional start/end date are also entered in this window.

When selection from a list is used, the same window is shown, but instead of providing a list for product selection, the product is shown as an un-editable value.   The other fields are the same.

Featured products are displayed prominently when your customers browser your catalog.  To learn more about this, read [how featured products are handled in the storefront](/user/products/featured_products/).
