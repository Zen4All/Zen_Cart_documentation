The Product Listing (or Index Listing) pages 
are [listing pages](/user/storefront_pages/listing_pages/) showing
all products in a specific category. 

These pages have their own configuration settings page, which is 
[Admin > Configuration > Product Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productlisting/).

On this page, the top settings are:

  - Display Product Image 
  - Display Product Manufacturer Name
  - Display Product Model
  - Display Product Name 
  - Display Product Price/Add to Cart
  - Display Product Quantity
  - Display Product Weight 

Each of these values is set the same way, with a zero (indicating do not display this field on the listing page) or a positive number (indicating display this field in this order). 

These values are also used when the [PRODUCT_LISTING_DEFAULT_SORT_ORDER](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productlisting/#display_product_listing_default_sort_order) field is set on the Admin > Configuration > Product Listing page.  See [sort order](/user/customizing/sort_order/) for more details.
