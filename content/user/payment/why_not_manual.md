Older payment modules like `credit card` and `CEON Manual Card` are not recommended for the following reasons: 

- they are not PCI Compliant
- storing credit card details in your database means both the store owner and the customer at risk in the event of a breach. 
- in some countries it is no longer legal to do this
- it could be a violation of your merchant agreement 

So what are your options? 

- Switch to a payment gateway.  There are many [payment processors Zen Cart supports](https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?14-Payment-Processing). 

- Use a plugin offering like [Authorize.net CIM Card on file](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2272) which handles credit card details securely.
