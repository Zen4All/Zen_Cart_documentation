1. You need to have purchases in your store first ... where customers bought "this" product along with "another" product.

2. Set: [Admin > Configuration > Product Info > Also Purchased Products Columns per Row](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productinfo/#also_purchased_products_columns_per_row). 

3. Set: [Admin > Configuration > Maximum Values >Also Purchased Products](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_maximumvalues/#also_purchased_products).
