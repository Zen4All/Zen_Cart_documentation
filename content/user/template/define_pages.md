Define pages are pre-built pages whose content can be set in the Admin, using [Admin > Tools > Define Pages Editor](/user/admin_pages/tools/define_pages). 

Using the admin, it is also possible to [enable and disable define pages](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_definepagestatus). 

If your needs go beyond what is provided by the define pages, take a look at the FAQ on [adding pages](/user/customizing/add_pages).
