This page allows you to view, add, edit or delete customer supplied reviews.

Customers enter reviews by clicking the *Write Review* button on 
the storefront's [product info](/user/products/product_info/) page.  They must login and can then leave a review.

Reviews may then displayed in the storefront in the following places:

- Product Reviews sidebox 
- Product Reviews page

You may configure whether or not reviews then require admin approval using
the [Product Reviews Require Approval](/user/admin_pages/configuration/all/#product_reviews_require_approval) setting on  the Configuration > Product Info screen.
