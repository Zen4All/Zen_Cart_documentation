Your plugins are submitted to the Plugins Library to make them accessible to Zen Cart users, but you may wish to consider taking an additional steps, and put your plugin under source control on Github.com.

There are a number of advantages to doing this: 

- Other developers can help you by submitting PRs and fixes.
- You can use your Github repo as evidence for your skills when talking to hiring managers and clients. 
- Github provides a per-repo Wiki that can be used for the creation of documentation.  Creating your documentation this way means it's easily sharable among collaborators and users.  

Examples of best-in-class Github repos that feature documentation are: 

- [Bootstrap Template](https://github.com/lat9/ZCA-Bootstrap-Template)
- [UPS Oauth](https://github.com/lat9/upsoauth)
- [PayPal RESTful API Payment Module](https://github.com/lat9/paypalr)

Clicking the "Wiki" link at the top of any of these repos will show you examples of plugin documentation.
