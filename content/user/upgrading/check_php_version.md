For non-cPanel configurations, work with your hoster.

If your hoster uses cPanel and MultiPHP Manager and click the dropdown labelled "PHP Version."

If your hoster uses cPanel and PHP Selector, click the dropdown next to it.

If you see that the version you want isn't available (for example, in the first screenshot, there is no PHP 8.1), you will have to work with your hoster.
