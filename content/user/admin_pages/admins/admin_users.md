Admin Users is a list of your admins and their respective profiles. 

![Admin Users](/images/admin_users.png)

From this page, you may change an admin's password or profile, or add or delete admins.

Profiles are created on the [Admins > Admin Profiles](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_profiles/) page. 

Zen Cart 2.1.0 introduces multi-factor authentication for admin access.  This feature may be enabled on the [Admin > Configuration > My Store](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_mystore/) page. 

Once this is done, it can be enabled or disabled per user.  See the [multi-factor authentication](/user/security/multifactor/) page for more details.
