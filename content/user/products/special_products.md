[Specials](/user/admin_pages/catalog/specials/) allow you to discount single products. 

Once you have done this, Zen Cart has a number of ways for you to show off your specials: 

- the built in Specials Page, which appears when you navigate to `YOURSITE.com/index.php?main_page=specials`.
- the optional Specials [Sidebox](/user/template/sideboxes/) 
- the optional Specials [Centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/)

You may also configure specials to appear in the following places: 

- on an empty shopping cart page with the setting on [Admin > Configuration > Stock](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/)
- below a [product listing](/user/products/product_listing/) using the settings on [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/)


Creating Specials is done on the [Admin > Catalog > Specials](/user/admin_pages/catalog/specials/) page.
