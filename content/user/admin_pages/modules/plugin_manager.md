The Plugin Manager page provides a single place to install and uninstall plugins created in accordance with the new [encapsulated plugin architecture](/dev/plugins/encapsulated_plugins/) introduced in 1.5.7. 

The base install of Zen Cart contains the Display Logs plugin, both as an example and as a useful feature.  Other encapsulated plugins are available in the [plugin library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php).
