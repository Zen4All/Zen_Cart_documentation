## 3.0.0 
- New Feature: <a href="https://github.com/zencart/zencart/discussions/6428">Child Templates</a> will be supported, so that storeowners can more easily determine what has been changed from the base release of a template. 
- Modernization: Zen Cart 3.0 will use Bootstrap 5. 
- Modernization: support for older `define` based language files will be dropped.  Moving forward, only [Array based language files](/dev/languages/158_language_files/) will be supported.
