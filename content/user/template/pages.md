The Zen Cart storefront is created when the software builds *pages*. 
For example, when a user browses

```
https://YOURSTORE.com/index.php?main_page=specials 
```

The page which is displayed is the Specials page.  The parts and layout of pagesis shown in the [page format](/user/template/page_format/) FAQ. 

The following types of pages are provided by Zen Cart: 

a) Standard pages, such as product_info, where the focus is one one thing.  On the product info page, the focus is on the product being viewed.

b) Listing pages, such as specials, which show multiple products.

c) Define pages, such as the Shipping Information page, which display content created by the storeowner.  A fixed set of define pages is provided. 

d) EZ-Pages, which display content according to the needs of the storeowner; an unliminted number of EZ-Pages may be created.  

In addition, pages may also be added to a store using these plugins:
