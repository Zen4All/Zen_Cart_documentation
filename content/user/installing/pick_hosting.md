As noted in [Basics - Hosting and Domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/#hosting-companies): 
- Your easiest installation option will be a Linux host running Apache with cPanel.
- The decision on whether to use Shared or VPS hosting will be determined by your budget, but VPS is recommended.
- The Zen Cart project recommends a number of hosting providers on
their [Recommended Services](https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?3-services) page.

Further Considerations: 
- One way to evalute hosts is to run the [test suite offered SSLLabs](https://ssllabs.com/ssltest).  You will want to make sure any host you consider has at least a B rating.  This will help make any PCI scan more likely to succeed.  The more secure your host, the more secure your site.
