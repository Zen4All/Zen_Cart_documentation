Older releases of Zen Cart do not track the stock of individual product variants (a t-shirt's stock of large versus medium, for example).  There are commercial modifications that address this requirement however, such as 
the [Products' Options' Stock Manager](https://vinosdefrutastropicales.com/product_extra_files/options_stock/readme.html).
Note that this plugin is sometimes called "Products Options Stock Manager" (without the apostrophes) or just "POSM."

There are also open source plugins which provide this capability; search for "Stock by Attributes."

In version 2.1.0 of Zen Cart, POSM has been added as a core feature.
See [the POSM wiki](https://github.com/lat9/options_stock_support/wiki) for more information.
