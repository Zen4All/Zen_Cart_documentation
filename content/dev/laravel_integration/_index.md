Starting with v1.5.8, Zen Cart leverages several aspects of the features that the Laravel Framework offers.

Initially this includes the `Eloquent` database ORM which provides a fluent interface for building SQL queries
based on models of Zen Cart's database tables.

We also take advantage of the bootstrapping code Laravel contains.
