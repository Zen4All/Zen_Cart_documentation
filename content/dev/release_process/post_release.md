- @TODO: THIS SHOULD BE WAY EARLIER, NOT A "POST" TASK: Download the release you just built and test it out.

- Unlock the Zen Cart project in Github. 

- Message all developers who have merge privileges using the Skype Dev Chat channel, and then unlock the branch you are building.  Go to [the branches page](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/settings/branches) and delete the branch protection rule you created earlier. 

- Begin process of formally merging release to Master/Main
