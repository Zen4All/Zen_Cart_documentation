This page contains a variety of settings for handling product pricing (and other product features) including price, 
[special price](/user/admin_pages/catalog/specials/) and 
[per-product quantity discounts](/user/products/quantity_discounts/).


**Note:** Don't confuse these **product** quantity discounts with [**attribute** quantity discounts](/user/products/attribute_pricing/#settings-in-attributes-controller), which are set in the [Attributes Controller](/user/admin_pages/catalog/attributes_controller/#quantity-discounts). Attribute quantity discounts allow you to reduce the price bulk purchases of a product *with a specific attribute*.
