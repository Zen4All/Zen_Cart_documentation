### EasyPopulate 

Rather than enter products one-by-one in the admin panel, some storeowners prefer to use tools that will import a CSV containing product information.  One such tool is called EasyPopulate.  Other spellings of this name include:

- "Easy Populate"
- "EZPopulate" 
- "EZ-Populate" 

You can find [EasyPopulate in the Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2069).
