Edit Orders is a plugin which allows you to modify orders after they have been placed. This can be useful in a number of situations: 

- Refunds or cancelled orders 
- Customer changed their mind or made a mistake 
- Product no longer available

Viewing an order in Edit Orders looks the same as viewing it in the Order Details screen, except that all fields are presented in an editable form.  In addition, products may be added to or removed from the order.

Note that using Edit Orders to increase the value of an order means you will have to manually [collect the balance owed](/user/payment/balance_owed/); this is not done automatically.
