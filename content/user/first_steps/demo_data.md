When you install Zen Cart, one of the prompts asks if you wish to install 
the demo data.  Doing so is an excellent way to see a store which is fully set up, allowing you to explore the features of Zen Cart.

Here are some common scenarios which are shown in the demo data: 

- uploads - product id 34 (A Bug's Life "Multi Pak") has attributes called "Logo Front" and "Logo Back" which are images the customer would upload. 
- downloads - product id 166 (Russ Tippins Band - The Hunter) has a downloadable attribute to show how to attach a digital media file to a product.  Product 180 shows a PDF file being attached to a product. 
- pricing by attributes - product id 47 (Gift Certificates by attributes) shows how to modify the price according to which radio button is selected. 
- color swatches -  product id 54 (Min and Units NOMIX) shows the use of color samples on a product.  Note that product 44 (A Mixed OFF Product with Attributes) also offers multiple colors but does not show swatches. 
- pricing by letter - product 134 has per letter pricing.

Demonstrations of many other features can be found simply by searching for the feature name.
