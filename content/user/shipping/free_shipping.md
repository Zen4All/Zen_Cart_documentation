During Checkout, the Shipping Selection page is automatically skipped if shipping does not apply to any products in the order.


## How do I tell the shopping cart that shipping does not apply?

Individually set products as `free shipping` by editing each one and setting `product is always free-shipping` button in the middle of the product-info/edit screen.

Then enable the `free shipping` module..

This will allow checkout to totally bypass the shipping page.
