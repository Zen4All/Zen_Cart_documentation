The Zen Cart storefront is created when the software builds *pages*. 
For example, when a user browses

```
https://YOURSTORE.com/index.php?main_page=specials 
```

the page which is displayed is the Specials page.  

The parts and layout of pages is shown in the [page format](/user/template/page_format/) FAQ. 

The following types of pages are provided by Zen Cart: 

a) Regular pages, such as product_info. 

b) Listing pages, such as specials, which show multiple products.

c) [Define pages](/user/template/define_pages/), such as the Shipping Information page, which display content created by the storeowner.  A fixed set of define pages is provided. 

d) [EZ-Pages](/user/ezpages/what_are_ezpages/), which display content according to the needs of the storeowner; an unlimited number of EZ-Pages may be created.  

In addition, you may add pages to your store by [creating a new page](/user/customizing/add_pages#create-a-new-page).
