# Language Constant Definition

In both the admin and the storefront environments, there are two groups of language constants:

1. Those that apply _globally_, i.e. on every loaded page.
2. Those that are _page-specific_.

The file-system sources for the associated language files is dependent on the environment (i.e. admin or storefront) in which your Zen Cart is currently running.

**Notes**:

- If a `lang.` file exists in the same directory as an un-prefixed file (e.g. `lang.stuff.php` and `stuff.php`), the un-prefixed file *is not loaded*, i.e. any definitions comes from the `lang.` file.
- While a `zc_plugin` cannot override a base language file, e.g. `lang.english.php`, it _can_ override constants defined in the base file via files in its `extra_definitions` sub-directory.
- Files in a language's `extra_definitions` sub-directory are loaded alphabetically and, if a constant is present in multiple files, the last-loaded value is what will be used for the constant.

## Admin Language Loading

For the admin, the language constants loaded depend on:

1. The active language, e.g. `english` or `spanish`.
2. The active page, referenced as `current_page` in this section.
3. The presence of any language-related files in enabled `zc_plugins`.

The `/admin/includes/languages` and `/zc_plugins/plugin_key/version/admin/includes/languages` directories hold all `.php` files that provide a site's admin language constants.

The actual text associated with an admin language-constant is determined by the constant's presence, based on this order:

1. If a constant is found in a file in `/admin/includes/languages/spanish/extra_definitions`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
2. If a constant is found in a file in a `zc_plugin`'s  `admin/includes/languages/spanish/extra_definitions`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
3. If a constant is found in `/admin/includes/languages/spanish/lang.current_page.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
4. If a constant is found in a `zc_plugin`'s  `admin/includes/languages/spanish/lang.current_page.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
5. If a constant is found in `/admin/includes/languages/lang.spanish.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
6. If a constant is found in a file in `/admin/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
7. If a constant is found in a file in a `zc_plugin`'s  `admin/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
8. If a constant is found in `/admin/includes/languages/english/lang.current_page.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
9. If a constant is found in a `zc_plugin`'s  `admin/includes/languages/english/lang.current_page.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
10. If a constant is found in `/admin/includes/languages/lang.english.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
11. A PHP Fatal error will most likely result, due to the language-constant's missing value.

## Storefront Language Loading

On the storefront, the language constants loaded depend on:

1. The active language, e.g. `english` or `spanish`.
2. The active template, referenced as `template_dir` in this section.
3. The active page, referenced as `current_page_base` in this section.
4. The presence of any language-related files in enabled `zc_plugins`.

The `/includes/languages` and `/zc_plugins/plugin_key/version/catalog/includes/languages` directories hold all `.php` files that provide a site's storefront language constants.

Each plugin (alphabetically loaded by its "Plugin Key", e.g. `DisplayLogs` for the "Display logs" plugin) is checked to see if it has supplied _additional_ constants for the current page.

### Storefront Global Language Constants

These constants are of two types:

1. The "base" language constants.
2. Extra language-constant definitions.

Let's pretend that a site is dual-language, the language currently selected by the customer is `spanish` and we're looking for the definition of `BOX_HEADING_REVIEWS`, which _should_ be present in `/includes/languages/lang.english.php`.

1. If the constant is found in a file in `/includes/languages/spanish/extra_definitions/template_dir`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
2. If the constant is found in a file in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/spanish/extra_definitions/default`<sup>1</sup>, it'll be used; otherwise ...
3. If the constant is found in a file in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/spanish/extra_definitions`<sup>1</sup>, it'll be used; otherwise ... 
4. If the constant is found in a file in `/includes/languages/spanish/extra_definitions`, it'll be used; otherwise ... 
5. If the constant is found in  `/includes/languages/template_dir/lang.spanish.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ... 
6. If the constant is found in  `/includes/languages/lang.spanish.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ... 
7. If the constant is found in a file in `/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/template_dir`, it'll be used; otherwise ...
8. If the constant is found in a file in `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/english/extra_definitions/default`<sup>1</sup>, it'll be used; otherwise ...
9. If the constant is found in a file in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/english/extra_definitions`<sup>1</sup>, it'll be used; otherwise ... 
10. If the constant is found in a file in  `/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions`, it'll be used; otherwise ... 
11. If the constant is found in  `/includes/languages/template_dir/lang.english.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ... 
12. If the constant is found in  `/includes/languages/lang.english.php`, it'll be used; otherwise ... 
13. A PHP Fatal error will most likely result, due to the language constant's missing value.

Notes:

<sup>1</sup> Prior to zc210, a constant found in a `zc_plugin`'s `extra_definitions` directory could not be overridden on the storefront.  See [this Zen Cart PR](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/pull/6493) for details.

### Storefront Page-Specific Constants

These constants are _specific_ to the page being loaded, as recorded in `$current_page_base`.  These language constants are loaded in a different manner than the global ones.

Let's pretend that a site is dual-language, the language currently selected by the customer is `spanish` and we're loading files for the `shippinginfo` page.

- First, the 'base' language file(s) for the current page are loaded and constants created based on the current language and template:

1. Constants found in  `/includes/languages/spanish/template_dir/lang.shippinginfo.php` that don't already exist are created.
2. Constants found in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/spanish/default/lang.shippinginfo.php` that don't already exist are created.
3. Constants found in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/spanish/lang.shippinginfo.php` that don't already exist are created.
4. Constants found in `/includes/languages/spanish/lang.shippinginfo.php` that don't already exist are created.
5. Constants found in `/includes/languages/english/template_dir/lang.shippinginfo.php` that don't already exist are created.
6. Constants found in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/english/default/lang.shippinginfo.php` that don't already exist are created.
7. Constants found in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/english/lang.shippinginfo.php` that don't already exist are created.
8. Constants found in `/includes/languages/english/lang.shippinginfo.php` that don't already exist are created.

- Next, any page-extension language files for the current page are loaded alphabetically and constants created. 

These files match the regex pattern `'~^' . 'lang.' . $current_page_base  . '(.+)\.php$~i'`.  In "english", that means that any file named (for the current example) `shippinginfo*.php` that isn't `shippinginfo.php` &mdash;Â for example, `shippinginfo2.php` or `shippinginfo_something.php`.  The files are loaded in alphabetic order. For brevity, we'll refer these files simply as `shippinginfo*.php` in the ordering below.

1. Constants found in  `/includes/languages/spanish/template_dir/lang.shippinginfo*.php` that don't already exist are created.
2. Constants found in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/spanish/default/lang.shippinginfo*.php` that don't already exist are created.
3. Constants found in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/spanish/lang.shippinginfo*.php` that don't already exist are created.
4. Constants found in `/includes/languages/spanish/lang.shippinginfo*.php` that don't already exist are created.
5. Constants found in `/includes/languages/english/template_dir/lang.shippinginfo*.php` that don't already exist are created.
6. Constants found in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/english/default/lang.shippinginfo*.php` that don't already exist are created.
7. Constants found in a `zc_plugin`'s `catalog/languages/english/lang.shippinginfo*.php` that don't already exist are created.
8. Constants found in `/includes/languages/english/lang.shippinginfo*.php` that don't already exist are created.
