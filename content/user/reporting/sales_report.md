[Sales Report](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=9) is the plugin that most Zen Cart storeowners use to build a sales dashboard.   It can create on-screen, print-ready or CSV format output with sales shown in a variety of ways. 

Here is the screen that allows you to configure the report:

And here is what the on-screen results look like:

For recent versions of Zen Cart, Sales Report is distributed as an [encapsulated plugin](/dev/plugins/encapsulated_plugins/).
