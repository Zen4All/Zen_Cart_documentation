Note: If a term is not in this list, you should use a web search to learn more about it.  This list is intended to be specific to Zen Cart with only a minimal number of additional generic terms. 

- Categories Tabs - [Categories Tabs](/user/new_user_topics/categories_tabs/) is the name of a feature that places a set of links to every category in your store across the width of your home page just below the logo and tagline. 
- Centerbox - a [centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/) is a block of content in the middle of the page.  
- cPanel - a branded hosting control panel which is very popular.  See [Hosting and Domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/). 
- Default Files - The file provided by the base software that provides some functionality which can be overridden using a template file.  See [Default files, template default and overrides](/user/first_steps/overrides/).
- Define Pages - [Define pages](/user/template/define_pages/) are special pieces of content that appear above normal page content for certain pages.
- Document Root - another term for "webroot." 
- Domain Name - (also "domain") the mnemonic name of your website.  The domain name of this site is `zen-cart.com`.  See [hosting and domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/).  A Name Server converts this mnemonic name into an IP Address. 
- Extra Pages - [Extra pages](/user/template/extra_pages/) are the three built-in additional content pages that people can use without needing to add software to their installation. 
- EZ-Pages - Zen Cart provides the ability for storeowners to create their own content pages without a developer through the [EZ-Pages](/user/ezpages/) facility. 
- Hoster - a company that provides servers for you to run your site on. See [hosting and domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/).
- IP Address - a number assigned to a piece of hardware connected to the Internet.  Computers identify each other by IP Address.  See [hosting and domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/).
- JavaScript - a scripting language that adds dynamic effects to your website. 
- Name Server - a piece of Internet infrastructure that converts a domain name to an IP Address.  See [hosting and domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/).
- Overrides - Zen Cart provides the capability of partitioning your changes from the base software; this is called the override feature.  See [Default files, template default and overrides](/user/first_steps/overrides/).
- Prefix - A prefix in your `configure.php` files allows you to have a special naming convention for your Zen Cart tables, to keep them separate from other tables in your database.  Using a prefix is no longer encouraged; you should simply have separate databases for each of your web based applications.  (This used to be expensive but is no longer so.)
- Responsive - a template is responsive if it is designed for mobile viewing (on a phone or tablet) as well as desktop viewing.  See [Responsive Templates](/user/template/responsive/). 
- Shared Hosting - a hosting configuration that allows you to share a server with other users to reduce cost.  See [Hosting and Domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/). 
- Sidebox - a [sidebox](/user/template/sideboxes/) is a block of content on the left or right hand side of your page, when viewed on a desktop.  
- SSL - Secure Sockets Layer.  A technology that allows you to securely transfer information between your webserver and a client browser.  See [hosting and domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/).
- Template - Set of files which provide the theme or skin (eg: layout, colors, fonts) for the site. See [Default files, template default and overrides](/user/first_steps/overrides/).
- Template Files - The individual files (css, js, php, and some images) involved in providing the Template for the site.  See [Default files, template default and overrides](/user/first_steps/overrides/).
- VPS - a hosting configuration that puts you on your own dedicated server.  See [Hosting and Domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/). 
- Webroot - The top level folder that is visible to someone using a web browser.  See [how do I install Zen Cart](/user/first_steps/how_do_i_install/). 
- Webserver - the computer associated with your hosting account that runs your website *or* the program on that hosting account that serves web pages (e.g. Apache).  See [hosting and domain concepts](/user/first_steps/hosting/).
- YOURACCOUNTFOLDER - the folder  in your hosting account which holds your site's files. See [basic terms](/user/first_steps/basic_terms/). 
- YOURLANGUAGE - the language your site is presented in, which is english by default.  See [basic terms](/user/first_steps/basic_terms/). 
- YOURSITE - the domain name you are using.  See [basic terms](/user/first_steps/basic_terms/).
