This page allows you to manage the list of featured products.  Products may be added to or removed from this list, and their dates for being on the list may optionally be set.  Since 1.5.7, products may be added by ID or by selection from a dropdown list.  

Featured products are displayed prominently when your customers browser your catalog.  Read more about how [Featured Products](/user/products/featured_products/) are handled in the storefront.
