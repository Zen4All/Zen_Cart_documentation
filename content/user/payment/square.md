Since v1.5.6 support for Square Payments is build-in to Zen Cart.

It is also distributed as a [plugin](/user/plugins/about_plugins/), so you can [obtain the latest version of Square Payments for Zen Cart](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=156) and upgrade (or add it to) your store as needed.

The setup instructions are in a [README file included with the plugin zip](https://github.com/zencart/square_payments_for_zencart).  
If you prefer, you may also [read the Square setup instructions here](https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?349-Square-Payments-for-Zen-Cart).
