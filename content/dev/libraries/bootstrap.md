## Bootstrap Template 

Bootstrap template version 3.X is based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/).  You can find the exact version of Bootstrap (`major.minor.patch`) in use by looking at the file `includes/templates/bootstrap/common/html_header.php`, which pulls in the Bootstrap javascript and css.

The Bootstrap template is described in more detail in the [storefront documentation on Bootstrap template](/user/template/bootstrap/).

## Bootstrap in Zen Cart Admin

Bootstrap has been used in the Zen Cart admin since Zen Cart version 1.5.5.
The following chart shows the association between Bootstrap and Zen Cart versions. 

Bootstrap | Zen Cart 
-----------|--------------
BS 3.4.1 | ZC 1.5.6-2.0.0
BS 3.3.7 | ZC 1.5.5

There is work underway to move the Zen Cart admin to Bootstrap 5. 
You may follow this effort by monitoring [this PR](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/pull/6173).
