### What controls which links are shown in the EZ-Pages sidebox? 

To get a link to a specific page into the this sidebox, go to [Tools > EZ-Pages](/user/admin_pages/tools/ezpages/), and edit the page you want to add.  Look at the settings for **Sidebox** (between **Header** and **Footer**). 

For the page to show up in the EZ-Pages sidebox, the Sidebox radio button must be set to *Yes* and the sort order must be greater than 0.
