Responsiveness - the ability to display properly on not just a desktop computer, but also mobile devices like phones and tablets - is a critical feature of modern templates. 

How do you know if a template is responsive? 

The easiest way would be to look at it on your smartphone.  

If you don't have a smartphone handy, or just want a quick test from your desktop web browser, you can use the mobile simulator that modern browsers generally come with.  

Here's how to do it in Google Chrome: 

1. Right click and select Inspect.

3. Now your page will display as if it were being rendered on a mobile device.  You can change the device using the dropdown at the top of the page.
