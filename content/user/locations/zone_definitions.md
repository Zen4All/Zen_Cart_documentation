If you are unclear on how zones are used in Zen Cart, please see the help pages for [Zones](/user/admin_pages/locations/zones/) and [Zone definitions](/user/admin_pages/locations/zones_definitions/). 

Zone Definitions can be created by adding each entry one at a time in the admin, or can be created quickly with some SQL commands that can be run in the Zen Cart Admin from the `Tools > Install SQL Patches` menu. 

Be careful when creating Zone Definitions such as Zone Definitions for the United States.  

```
Country: United States  
Zone: All Zones  
```

is the United States with All Zones that includes all 50 States, DC, US Islands and Territories such as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and the Armed Forces.  

If you need to distinguish your definition of the United States, then you need to specifically add the setting for the  

```
Country: United States  
Zone: (specific Zone here)  
```

Be careful to note the `geo_zone_id` in each of the INSERTs below. They are unique from one another so that they do not conflict with each other. You also need to ensure that they are unique on your site, meaning, that you have not already used the `geo_zone_id` for another Zone Definition. You can check this by going to your Zen Cart Admin and checking the Localization > Zone Definitions.  If you click on the Zone Definition, you will see in the URL the `zID=XX` which will indicate the `geo_zone_id` that is being used.
