The base template is Zen Cart is called [template_default](/user/template/template_default/). 

`classic` is a sample custom template. You can create your own custom templates;  `classic` is just an example. Anything that's not in your custom template but exists in template_default will be automatically loaded from template_default for you. Thus, when you're building a custom template, all you need in your custom template folder are the files/folders that you've customized/changed/added. Everything else is taken from the [default files](/user/first_steps/overrides/#default-files). 

`responsive_classic` is another sample custom template, but it is more modern than `classic`. It was designed [to be responsive](/user/template/responsive/), which is a way of saying that it works on mobile devices.  When the `classic` template was created, there were no mobile devices, so that wasn't a concern.

## Commercial Templates 

There are software vendors who sell templates for Zen Cart.  Many of them are extremely visually attractive.  But exercise caution! 

- Some of these templates were built for WordPress, not Zen Cart, so they don't respect configuration settings and are much harder to work on.
- Some of these templates were built for much older versions of Zen Cart, and haven't been upgraded.  
- Some of these templates remove large pieces of core files to simplify the template builder's job, which means that things you would expect to work do not. 

Be sure to discuss these issues with your template provider and make the transaction with an awareness of what you are taking on.
