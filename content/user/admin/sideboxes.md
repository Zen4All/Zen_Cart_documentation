[Sideboxes](/user/template/sideboxes) are narrow pieces of content that are displayed on the left and right side of the screen in the Zen Cart storefront in a desktop view.  

Sideboxes display is controlled by [Admin > Tools > Layout Boxes Controller](/user/admin_pages/tools/layout_boxes_controller/). 

You can also turn sideboxes off on a per page basis by modifying your template.  See [suppressing sidebox display](/user/sideboxes/suppressing_sidebox_display/) for details.
