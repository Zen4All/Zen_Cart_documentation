There are many cases where it is beneficial to login to a customer's account. 

- Troubleshooting a problem they are experiencing
- Placing an order on their behalf 
- Pre-loading the cart for them to complete an order.

The [Login as Customer](/user/running/login_as_customer/) feature allows you to 
select a customer's account in Admin > Customers and login as them using your admin credentials
by clicking the "Place Order" button on the side box showing their account. 

Prior to Zen Cart version 1.5.7, logging in as a customer was possible using one of these addons:

- [Admin Login as Customer](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=583)
