Payment modules allow you to collect or arrange payment for an order.

You can manage your store's payment modules by going to [Admin > Modules > Payment](/user/admin_pages/modules/payment/).

### Available Modules
More payment modules may be found in the [Payment module section of the Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=8).

### Creating A Module
Developers wishing to create a payment module should see the [dev FAQs on modules](/dev/code/modules/). 

### Finding A Payment Provider
If you don't already have an account, please use these [direct links to the payment processors Zen Cart supports](https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?14-Payment-Processing). By signing up via one of our links, you help support the Zen Cart project with small commissions that these providers give back to Zen Cart. Thank you in advance.
