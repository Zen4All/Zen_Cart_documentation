The [Bootstrap template](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2191) is a well supported, standards-based [responsive](/user/template/responsive/) template which was built by the Zen Cart community. 

Instead of using the [Mobile_Detect](http://mobiledetect.net/) library to determine the screen characteristics, it uses CSS media queries.  It does not use separate CSS files for each device type, and the CSS it does use is much more compact than what is used by the older [Responsive Classic](/user/template/responsive_classic/) template.
