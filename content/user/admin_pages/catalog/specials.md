This page allows you to view, edit or delete special pricing. 

Specials are price reductions on individual products, versus [Sales](/user/admin_pages/catalog/salemaker/), which are price reductions on one more more categories of products.  See [Salemaker vs Specials](/user/miscellaneous/salemaker_vs_specials/).

Opening up the specials page shows a list of the specials that have been created.

Since 1.5.7, Specials can be added in one of two ways: 

- By selection (from a list of all products)

- By Product ID (from a text field where the product ID is entered)

The latter technique was added because a list of all products is unwieldy for stores with a large number of SKUs. 

When selection from a list is used, a new window is opened allowing the product to be selected.  The special price and an optional start/end date are also entered in this window.

When selection from a list is used, the same window is shown, but instead of providing a list for product selection, the product is shown as an un-editable value.   The other fields are the same.
