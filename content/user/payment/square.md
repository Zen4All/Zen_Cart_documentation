There are two Square modules for Zen Cart: 
- A newer one, based on the Square Web Payments API, which is currently available as the [Square Web Payments API plugin](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2345). 
- An older one, based on the Square Payments Form library.  This was built in to Zen Cart from 1.5.5 to 1.5.7.  Please note this library has been deprecated by Square, and the older module will cease to work in July 2022.  The [Square Payments Form documentation](/user/payment/square_payments_form/) is maintained for historical purposes. 

## Newer Module - Square Web Payments API 
The newer Square module is available in the Plugins library as [Square Web Payments API plugin](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2345).
