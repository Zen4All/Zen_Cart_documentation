You have several options if you want to add a page to your site.  Here they are, in increasing order of complexity: 

a) Use [EZ-Pages](/user/ezpages/what_are_ezpages)

EZ-Pages are a great way to add new text content to your site. 
The one restriction they have is that you can't execute any PHP code on them,
but for many situations, this is not required.

b) Use the built-in extra pages, [page_2](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_definepagestatus/#define_page_2), [page_3](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_definepagestatus/#define_page_3) and [page_4](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_definepagestatus/#define_page_4).

Turn on these pages from [Admin > Configuration > Define Page Status](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_definepagestatus/) as shown above, then modify the page content using the [Define Pages Editor](/user/admin_pages/tools/define_pages/). 

c) Create a new page

The best way to create a new page is to use one of these plugins as a starting point: 

- [About Us](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=86) 

- [Skinny About Us](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2198) 

The latter is somewhat less customizable but contains fewer files.
