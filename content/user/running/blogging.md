Running a blog (WordPress), a forum (phpBB, Simple Machines), or a wiki on the website where you run your shopping cart is something many Zen Cart users find attractive. 

The problem is, these software packages don't maintain themselves.  You need to keep them updated or **you run the risk of being hacked**.  Even if you keep them updated, sometimes plugins are compromised by bad guys to enable sites to be hacked.  This is not just a theoretical risk - companies like Securi get most of their business from WordPress installations that have been hacked. 

So what are some alternative options?


### Create content using EZ-Pages 

The Zen Cart [EZ-Pages](/user/ezpages/) system allows you to create content using a secure, controlled facility.  This content can then be displayed on your site. 

### Create and send a newsletter regularly

Tools like MailChimp have inexpensive offerings for small businesses that allow you to stay in touch with your customers.  You can even preserve your content in a [campaign archive](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-email-campaign-archives-and-pages/) so customers who come along after you sent it can still see it. 

### Create a blog offsite

Really committed to a blog, are you?  Instead of self-hosting a WordPress blog, use wordpress.com and let them host it.
