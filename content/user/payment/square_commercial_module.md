The Square WebPay module for PHP 8 and above is a commercial plugin. 

It should be purchased from [the developer](https://mxworks.cc/?product=square-plugin-with-applepay-and-google-pay-for-php-8-x-with-zen-cart), and all questions directed to him. 

The current version of Square WebPay supports 

- Credit Cards
- Apple Pay
- Google Pay

You may enable or disable each of these independently.  Here's a site with all three:
