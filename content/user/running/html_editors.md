Editing HTML content in places like [EZ-Pages](/user/ezpages/) and [Define Pages](/user/template/define_pages/) is made much easier with an HTML Editor. 

- Zen Cart 2.2.0 and higher comes with TinyMCE.  If you wish to use TinyMCE in a prior version of Zen Cart, see [this PR](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/pull/6984/files). 
- Zen Cart 1.5.7-2.1.0 were shipped with CKEditor.
