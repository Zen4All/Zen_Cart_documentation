Translations are done on a volunteer basis, so the quality and even installation instructions may vary. The standard installation instructions are in the [Storeowner Docs > Admin Pages > Localization > Languages](/user/admin_pages/localization/languages/)

You are always welcome to help improve a translation, by either making your suggestions known to the author of the translation or by making your wanted changes yourself.
