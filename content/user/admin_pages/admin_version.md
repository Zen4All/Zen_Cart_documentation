The `Version` link at the top right hand side or your admin page takes you to the 
[Tools > Server/Version Info](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info/) page. 

It shows information about your server configuration,
including PHP and MySQL versions and settings, as well as 
your Zen Cart version and database history. 
<br /><br />

**Clicking this link is the fastest way to get your version information**.
In order to get help on the forum, you will need to provide this information.
