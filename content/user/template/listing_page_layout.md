Listing Pages are used to show groups of results.  Examples of listing pages are: 

- New Products 
- Featured Products
- All Products

There are specific configurations for these pages: 

- The New Products page is configured by [Admin > Configuration > New Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_newlisting/).
- The Featured Products page is configured by [Admin > Configuration > Featured Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_featuredlisting/).
- The All Products page is configured by [Admin > Configuration > All Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_alllisting/).
- Pages the products in a category are configured by [Admin > Configuration > Product Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productlisting/).

These four pages are share the same layout: stacked rows with one product per row.  This is different from a grid-style page like Specials.  Grid pages are laid out like the home page, with one main [centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/). 
[Listing pages are paginated](/user/template/pagination/) so that only a subset of the total number of results are shown.  Navigation is provided between blocks of results. 

The [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/) page works differently.  It is explained in the [Index Listing Configuration](/user/template/index_listing) FAQ.
