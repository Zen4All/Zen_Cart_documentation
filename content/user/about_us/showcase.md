Zen Cart storeowners may add their stores to a curated list by following the 
[Showcase](https://www.zen-cart.com/showcase.php) link in the Zen Cart forum,
selecting an area, and then pressing the `Add new link` button.

The rules for showcase listing are as follows:

- Your operational shop must use Zen Cart.
- You must have the reciprocal link [Powered by Zen Cart](https://www.zen-cart.com) in the footer.
- Your shop will be verified by a Zen Cart staff member.
- Only one submission per shop. Please choose the most appropriate category. We reserve the right to change the category or edit your description, if needed. Shops that are displaying the default text or demonstration products or selling adult products will be rejected without notice.
