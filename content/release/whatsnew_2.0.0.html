                See the online docs for upgrading advice, including Release-Specific considerations to note regarding this version. <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/upgrading/">https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/upgrading/</a>

            </h2>
            <p>
                If you are upgrading from the prior release, please do a <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/upgrading/detailed_upgrading/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">standard site upgrade</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are upgrading from a release which is older than the prior release, you may wish to consider starting again using a <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/upgrading/db_only_upgrade/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">database only upgrade</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Many older templates are going to be difficult to bring forward. If you are using an older template - especially one that is not <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/template/responsive/">responsive</a> - you may wish to consider migrating to <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/template/responsive_classic/">Responsive Classic</a> or <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/template/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be sure to review all the links in this article, including tips on staging the upgrade in a separate directory/folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are using Addons/Plugins that use modified versions of core Zen Cart files, you must compare those plugin files to the original Zen Cart files of the version for which those plugins were built, to identify the modifications. Subsequently you must replicate those modifications in the release version of the file.  Be sure to check the plugin's support thread to see if a new version has been released since the one you installed before.

                Upgrading to a Responsive Template 
            </h1>
            <p>
            If your site doesn't look good on a mobile phone or a tablet, it's likely because it's using an older non-responsive template.  You can read about <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/template/responsive/">Responsive Templates</a> on the help site to learn more.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you are upgrading an older site, we recommend that you use a responsive template (rather than template_default or any older non-responsive template) as the starting point for your upgraded site.  Both the <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/template/responsive_classic/">Responsive Classic</a> and <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/template/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> templates are good candidates.

                Upgrader Notes About Changes to template_default
            </h1>
            <p>
                Upgraders should make sure they update <em>*BOTH*</em> template_default <em>*AND*</em> their custom templates as described here
            </p>
            <p>
                In Zen Cart the <em>template_default</em> directory contains the master copy of all storefront page templates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The normal procedure for customizing template files for use in your own personalized template is to make a copy of the corresponding file from template_default, put it into your own template folder (and matching folder structure), and make your customizations in that copy of the file.
            </p>
            <p>
                This way the only files you need in your personalized template folder are those that you have altered in some way from template_default.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that explained, it is important that whenever you upgrade your site, you should also inspect ALL the template_default files to determine which changes in those files need to be replicated in your customized files.
                Comparison/Merging Tools are essential for this process; see the <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/first_steps/useful_tools/">Zen Cart Developer Tools</a> for recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process is simple: compare the template_default directory files from your <em>*old*</em> version to the template_default files in the <em>*new*</em> version, and replicate any differences in the files in your custom/personalized template in your store. If you based your template on responsive_classic, you should also compare and merge any changes from that template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, and only after you have done all those comparisons and updated your customized files in your custom template folder, you will copy the template_default files from the new version into the template_default directory of your store. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This way you will be left with updated personalized files <em>*and*</em> updated template_default files.

            <h1>
                Language Files in Zen Cart 1.5.8 and above 
            </h1>
            <p>
            Upgraders from prior versions of Zen Cart will notice a signficant change to the language files in this version.  Because of new stricter PHP standards, simply doing a <i>define</i> on language file constants (with multiple define operations being done when overrides were present) was not an approach that could be used. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Zen Cart now uses <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/localization/158_language_files/">Array based language files</a>.  For plugins with language files which are not overridden, the older style may still be used.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you're doing an upgrade and are worried about all the language file changes you'll have to figure out, rather than porting *all* your customizations, you may want to start small and add customizations as they are needed.  Many older templates made unnecessary changes which you will not want to carry forward.  See <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/localization/basic_158_language_customizations/">basic language file customizations</a> for a minimal starting list.
            </p>
