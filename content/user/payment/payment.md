Payment modules allow you to collect or arrange payment for an order.

The list of available payment modules may be seen by going to [Admin > Modules > Payment](/user/admin_pages/modules/payment/).

### Built-in Payment Modules 

The following modules are built-in to Zen Cart: 

- Authorize.net - both [AIM](/user/payments/authorizenet_aim/) and [SIM](/user/payments/authorizenet_sim/) are available
- Check/Money Order - Receive payment by check
- Cash on Delivery - COD or in-person payment
- Free Order - required if you have free products in your store
- PayPal - payment processing by [PayPal](/user/payments/paypal/)
- Square - payment processing by [Square](/user/payments/square/)

If you are just evaluating Zen Cart or running a test-only installation, 
then using the Check/Money Order module to process payments is the best option.

### Available Modules
More payment modules may be found in the [Payment module section of the Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=8).

### Creating A Module
