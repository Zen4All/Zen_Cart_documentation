There are two Square modules for Zen Cart: 
- A newer one, based on the Square Web Payments API 
- An older one, based on SqPaymentForm, which will be deprecated in 2022

Square users will need to move to the new [Square Web Payments API plugin](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2345). 

## Newer Integration - Square API 
The newer Square integration is available in the Plugins library as [Square Web Payments API plugin](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2345). 

Please note that the newer integration requires PHP 7.4, so you will need
to be running Zen Cart 1.5.7 or higher. If you need to upgrade, please 
review the [upgrading instructions](/user/upgrading/). 

## Older Integration - SqPaymentForm 
The original Square integration was built in to Zen Cart 1.5.6 and 1.5.7.

It is also distributed as a [plugin](/user/plugins/about_plugins/), so you can [obtain the latest version of Square Payments for Zen Cart](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=156) and upgrade (or add it to) your store as needed.

The setup instructions are in a [README file included with the plugin zip](https://github.com/zencart/square_payments_for_zencart).  
If you prefer, you may also [read the Square setup instructions here](https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?349-Square-Payments-for-Zen-Cart).
