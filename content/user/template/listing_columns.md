Since 1.5.7, Zen Cart includes a configuration setting called [Columns Per Row](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productlisting/#columns_per_row).  This setting allows you to display multiple columns of products per row on the Product Listing page. 

**Note:** Your template must also support this setting.  Both the Responsive Classic and Bootstrap templates support this setting.  Many older templates use a version of the Column Grid Layout plugin, which is deprecated by this setting.

This is what it looks like when `Columns Per Row` is set to 3.

This is what it looks like when `Columns Per Row` is set to 1.  The value 1 may be considered to be "rows mode."

Note that the setting `Columns Per Row` only applies to Product Listing pages, not other listing pages such as All Products or New Products.
