Problem: My products are being displayed with a different price then I set! If I set something at $2 it ends up listing at 2.22. I have set that prices should not show with tax, I haven't set any tax rates yet.

Chances are that you have changed your currency settings, and your "default" currency is not set to a value of 1.0.
Please visit Admin > Localization > Currencies and set your default currency to value of 1.0

If this does not work please re-ask your question on the 
[main support forum](https://www.zen-cart.com/forum.php).
and supply a URL where it can be seen in action.
Please also list which version of Zen Cart you are using and which currencies you have installed, which one is the default,  and which languages you have installed.
