This is a partial list of regular maintenance activities you should do on your store.  Try to do these things once a month. 

- Make a [database backup](/user/running/backup/)
- [Archive and purge old admin activity logs](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_activity_logs/#purging-logs)
- Investigate any [debug logs](/user/troubleshooting/debug_logs/) which are present in your `/logs` folder 
- Check to see if there is a [new Zen Cart version available](/user/admin_pages/admin_new_version_available/) and schedule your [upgrade](/user/upgrading/) if you need to upgrade
- Check your SSL certificate - they do expire and need renewing, and if there's a glitch (like your credit card expired), you will have the dreaded [broken padlock](/user/running/broken_padlock/).
