cPanel is the name of a very popular web control panel.  A control panel is a web application that helps users manage their hosting accounts and websites.

Most hosting packages will come with a control panel, but if it doesn't say "cPanel," it's likely a hoster-built application with a small subset of cPanel's functionality. **cPanel is much better and worth paying for.**

The cPanel home page will look something like this: 

![cPanel Home Page](/images/cpanel_home.jpg)

The cPanel login page will look something like this:

The login URL for cpanel will probably look like one of these: 

```
https://YOURSITE.com/cpanel
https://YOURSITE.com:2083/
```

On some hosters, you will have to login to your hosting account first, then click a button to get to cPanel.
