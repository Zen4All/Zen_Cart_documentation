In Zen Cart 2.0.0 and higher, accessibility page for your store may be accessed at `index.php?main_page=accessibility`.  

You can fill in the details of your accessibility statement using the [Define Pages Editor](/user/admin_pages/tools/define_pages/).

You can do a web search on "accessibility statement" to get some ideas for the content you should have on this page.  The specifics may be jurisdiction-dependant. 

A possible starting point would be something like: 

> YOURNAME is committed to keeping our site accessible to everyone. 
> We welcome feedback on ways to improve this site's accessibility.
>
> Telephone number / Email address / Contact form URL

The accessibility page is built in to version 2.0.0 of Zen Cart.  An [accessibility page plugin](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2383) is available as a plugin for older versions.
