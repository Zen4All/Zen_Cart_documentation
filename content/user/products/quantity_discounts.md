The 
[Admin -> Catalog -> Products Price Manager](/user/admin_pages/catalog/products_price_manager/) page allows you to add per product quantity discounts. 

- Select the product
- Press the *Edit Product* button
- click the *Add 5 Blank Discount Qty* button
- fill in the details
- Update

The screen you see will look like this:

The radio button *Discount Qty Applies to Mixed Attributes*  is referring
to the [MIXED ON](/user/products/products_misc/#what-does-mixed-on-mean) setting from the [product editing page](/user/products/product_edit/).
