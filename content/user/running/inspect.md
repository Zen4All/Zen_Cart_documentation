Google Chrome's "Inspect" tool is a tremendous help to anyone creating websites.  

In Google Chrome, right click and select "Inspect."

A dialog will come up with a number of options on the top menu bar.
Here are some things to explore: 

- Clicking "Console" will show you reports of any missing or unavailable files (JavaScript, CSS, etc.) 

- Clicking "Lighthouse" will perform a test that will analyse your site speed and whether you are using [outdated JavaScript libraries](/user/upgrading/javascript_updates/)

- Clicking "Elements" will show you the CSS rules that apply to each part of your site, enabling you to try changes right from your browser

Other browsers have similar built in developer tools; pick your favorite and learn as much as you can about it to keep your site in tip-top shape!
