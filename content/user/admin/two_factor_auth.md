Two Factor authentication is a system wherein a successful login requires something you know (such as a password) and something you have (such as email).   You probably already have something like this for your bank account. 

PCI 4.0 requires that your admin use two-factor authentication.  To help you comply with this requirement, Zen Cart has added the following: 

- Two factor authentication by email: You will be emailed a code to enter into your admin screen after you have successfully authenticated by password. 

- Two factor authentication by Google Authenticator: Smartphone owners who have the Google Authenticator app can use that in lieu of authentication by email.
